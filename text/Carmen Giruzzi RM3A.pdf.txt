Clinical Context

Comments And Suggestions Of The Risk Analysis

Observations

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

No autonomic dysfunction detected.

ANSD:
SudoD: Mild Microcirculation disorder
Mildly reduced C-Fiber velocity
Moderately decreased sweat gland function

EndoD: Mild Endothelial dysfunction has been detected. L-Arginine has been suggested also for improving the Endothelial function.
IR:
CMR:
SFN:
CAN:

Significant Abnormal result. Lifestyle change is suggested.
Moderate abnormal result. Further lab tests (Fasting BG and OGTT) are suggested
Significant result. Further supplementary exams comprised in Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score are suggested.
Borderline result.
Moderate failure of parasympathetic response.
Mild sympathetic over response is detected.

PTG CVD:Mild endothelial and ANS dysfunction detected. Cardiometabolic Profile lab tests are suggested.

*Off label use. Results have been tested in clinical studies.

The correlations between 2h- OGTT Glucose and Cardiometabolic
Risk score (CMRS) were:  r = 0.56 (p = 0.003).
 
Small fiber neuropathy risk using the sudomotor response score
had a sensitivity of 91.4 % and specificity of 79.1% to detect
diabetic neuropathy symptoms score >=1.
 
PTG CVD is calculated from the PTG Spectral Analysis markers.
Comparing group with CAD and control group, spectral Analysis Markers 
have a sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 96.8% to detect CAD.
Off label use. Results have been tested in clinical studies.

DISCLAIMERS: This report is only for the referring physician and cannot be promoted. The patient profile risk analysis chart and comments and suggestions cannot be used for diagnostic purposes.
It is the referring physician's responsibility to make proper judgments based on these numbers and suggestions. All results should be considered within the clinical context of the patient's case
history, symptoms, known diagnosis, findings from other diagnostics studies, current medications, treatment plan and therapies.
